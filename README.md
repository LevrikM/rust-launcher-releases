## ⚡ What is Rust Launcher?

Rust Launcher is a specialized utility designed to improve your gaming experience without breaking the rules. It allows you to fine-tune hidden game settings, force custom resolutions (like Stretched) without blur, and clean up system bloat—all through a modern, user-friendly interface.

It works by modifying the official `client.cfg` and Steam launch parameters, making it **completely safe** to use.

| **🚀 FPS Boost** | Disables hidden debris, shadows, and unnecessary effects via `client.cfg` to maximize performance. |
| **🖥️ True Resolution** | Forces custom resolutions (e.g., 1080x1080) for a sharp, stretched image without the "soapy" blur. |
| **⚡ Server browser** | Add your favourite server to launcher and browse online, map and status directly. |
| **🧹 Smart Cleaner** | Automatically clears old cache, logs, and skin files to fix stutters and free up disk space. |

## 📥 Installation Guide

1.  **Download:** Go to the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/LevrikM/rust-launcher-releases/releases/latest)**.
2.  **Get the File:** Download `Rust-Launcher-Setup-x.x.x.exe`.
3.  **Install:** Run the installer. The launcher will automatically detect your Rust installation path.
4.  **Play:** Launch the app, apply your tweaks, and hit **PLAY**.

> **Note:** If Windows Defender shows a warning (SmartScreen), this is normal for new software without a costly digital signature.
> Click **"More Info"** -> **"Run Anyway"**.

## 🛡️ Safety & Anti-Cheat

Is this safe? **YES.**

* ✅ **VAC / EAC Safe:** The launcher **DOES NOT** inject code into memory and **DOES NOT** modify game executable files (`.exe`, `.dll`).
* ✅ **Config Only:** All optimizations are applied strictly through official configuration files (`client.cfg`) and Steam launch arguments.
* ✅ **Open Transparency:** We do not use macros or scripts that affect recoil or gameplay mechanics.
